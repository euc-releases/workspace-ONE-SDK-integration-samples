# Task: Configure end users
Configuring end users in the UEM management console is a system administrator
task for application developers. The following instructions refer to some
concepts introduced in the [Task: Configure management console enrollment](../03Task_Configure-management-console-enrollment/readme.md).

The end user configuration described in this guide is intended only to support
application development, not for production Workspace ONE deployments. 

This guide doesn't cover end user configuration in depth. The recommendations
here are intended to support application development only and aren't suitable
for production Workspace ONE deployments. See the system administrator user
guides for the Workspace ONE product for authoritative and complete information.

See the [Recommended End User Configuration](01Recommended-End-User-Configuration/readme.md)
for details.
