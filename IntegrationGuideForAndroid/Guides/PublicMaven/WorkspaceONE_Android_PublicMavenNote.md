# Tasks and Documentation
Integration of an Android application with the Workspace ONE platform includes a
number of tasks for the application developer. Instructions for these tasks are
given in a set of documents: the Workspace ONE Integration Guide for Android.

The integration guide documents are available in the [Workspace ONE Android SDK Overview](https://developer.omnissa.com/ws1-sdk-for-android/).

# Open Source Sample Code
Open Source sample code for integration of Android applications with Workspace
ONE is published to a GitHub repository. The build files in the repository have 
been updated to utilize the public Maven repository.

The sample code repository is here:

Each app directory has the following build files.
