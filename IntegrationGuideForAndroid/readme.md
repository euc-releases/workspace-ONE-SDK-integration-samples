# Workspace ONE for Android Integration Guide Code
Android applications can be integrated with the VMware Workspace ONEÂ® platform,
by using its mobile software development kit. The Workspace ONE Integration
Guide for Android is a set of documents that contain instructions for
integration. This repository holds the code that is included in the guide
documents.

The code is organised as a project that can be built, for example with an
integrated development environment (IDE) such as Android Studio.
