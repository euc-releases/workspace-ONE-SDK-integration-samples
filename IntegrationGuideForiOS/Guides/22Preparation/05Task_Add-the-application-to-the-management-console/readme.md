# Task: Add the application to the management console
Adding an application to the management console is a task for application
developers. You will need the iOS Package Archive (IPA) file from the
[Task: Generate an application installer file](../04Task_Generate-an-application-installer-file/readme.md).
The following instructions assume that you have the IPA file already.

You can add an application to the Workspace ONE Unified Endpoint Manager (UEM)
console by following these instructions. These are provided here for application
developer convenience and aren't intended to replace the system administrator
user guides for the Workspace ONE product.
